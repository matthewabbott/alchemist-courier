## SA.1: SpriteAssigner: load PNG + grid overlay + cell clicking
Built the first sprite-tools feature: a standalone Godot tool scene for assigning polyomino
shapes to sprite art. The tool overlays a configurable grid (4x4, 6x6, or 8x8) on top of a
loaded PNG, lets the user click cells to define a shape, and auto-detects which of the 9
canonical polyomino shapes it matches (trying all 4 rotations). This is the foundation for
the human-in-the-loop art pipeline where generated sprites get matched to game shapes.
